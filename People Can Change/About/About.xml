<description>Occasionally, colonists will change their minds about things. They can gain a trait, lose a trait, or have the trait's degree change. This occurs about twice as often as cargo pods drop (or so, everything's random).

Overview:
Traits can be gained as long as a colonist doesn't have 4 traits already
Traits can be lost
Traits with multiple degrees can change

A few traits won't change, be removed, or be added, for various reasons:
Beauty traits, annoying voice, and creepy breathing because they're physical traits not psychological, and beauty is already affected by Disfigured. 
Gay because I don't want to get into a debate about whether sexuality can change like what happened early in RimWorld development.
Brawler because I personally think Brawler is just stupid and your best shooter becoming a brawler is super annoying.
Jealous, careful/trigger-happy shooter, and very/neurotic because the game doesn't let me change these ones for some reason. I'll look into them.

Events may cause a colonist to change their ways (e.g. a colonist eats human flesh and discovers they like it, becomes cannibal; or a colonist is depressed for a while and loses trait optimist)

Psychological disorders (treated by someone with good social; if they progress too far lead to mental breaks or suicide)
